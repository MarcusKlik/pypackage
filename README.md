# fst for Python

## Overview

The fst package for Python provides a fast, easy and flexible way to serialize DataFrames.
With access speeds of multiple GB/s, fst is specifically designed to unlock the potential of high speed solid state
disks that can be found in most modern computers.
Data frames stored in the fst format have full random access, both in column and rows.
